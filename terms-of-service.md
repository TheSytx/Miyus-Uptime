To use the Service, you must be at least 13 years old. The Service is not designed for use by individuals under 13. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years old. If local laws require a higher age limit, you must comply with that limit.

## 3. Intellectual Property
Unauthorized use of any content or materials belonging to us that are used within our services is strictly prohibited.

## 4. Availability, Errors, and Inaccuracies
We are constantly updating our products and service offerings on the Service. There may be delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, inaccurately described, or unavailable on the Service, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service. We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.

## 5. Links to Other Websites
Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Uptime Boat. Uptime Boat has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.

## 6. Termination
We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.

## 9. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of TÃ¼rkiye, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.

## 10. Changes
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
